# baguette

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of baguette is to provide efficient functions that can be used to create ensemble models. 

Currently in development/draft. Major to-do's are:

 * Convert model objects to expressions _a la_ `tidypredict`
  
 * To compute out-of-bag performance, pass in a `yardstick` `metric_set` object

 * Test out `hardhat` more

 * Add tree-based models for two-class models that have asymmetric costs for each class 

 * Parallelize using `furrr` when creating the models

## Installation

For now:

``` r
devtools::install_github("topepo/baguette")
```

## Example
